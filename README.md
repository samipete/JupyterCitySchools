# JupyterCitySchools

This code analyzes district-wide standardized test results and consists of:

    1. A District Summary
    2. A School Summary
    3. The Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    4. The Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    5. Math Scores by Grade
    6. Reading Scores by Grade
    7. Scores by School Spending
    8. Scores by School Size
    9. Scores by School Type

This code also begins with a written report of the analysis which summarizes the data and draws two main conclusions: 1) district schools may benefit from investing in extra resources for math and 2) smaller class sizes may support better learning, especially in math
